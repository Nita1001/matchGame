# Guess The Anime Game

Welcome to Guess The Anime Game!
This simple game was developed as part of my Full Stack Bootcamp exercise assignments.
It challenges players to identify the anime that a given character comes from, putting their knowledge of the genre to the test.
Whether you're a seasoned anime fan or just starting out, this game offers a fun and engaging way to put your skills to the test!

The objective of the game is to correctly guess which anime a character is from based on their image.
The game ends when you have correctly guessed 10 anime characters.

# How to Play
Once you start the game, an anime character image and the name of a different anime character will be displayed on the screen. You must guess whether the character's name displayed on the screen matches the name of the character in the image by clicking the "Correct" button or the "Confused" button.

If you guess correctly, a smiley face will appear, and your score will increase by one.
If you guess incorrectly, a sad face will appear, and your score will not change.

The game ends when you have correctly guessed 10 anime characters
